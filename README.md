# ICSTD - InnerCore Standard Library
**InnerCore** is a modding API for **Minecraft BE** 1.11.4 and 1.16.201, successor of CoreEngine. In past, when CoreEngine was actual all mods were written in JavaScript, so this bindness to JavaScript is still here and it makes Java mod development uncomfortable on InnerCore  
This library was made to fix this problem, become easiest and main solution for Java modding on InnerCore platform. We only target 1.16.201 cuz 1.11.4 is marked as **legacy**

## Making your first mod with ICSTD
Docs are in early WIP stage as same as library itself, so just wait ðŸ‘€
