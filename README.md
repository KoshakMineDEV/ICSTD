# ICSTD - InnerCore Standard Library
**InnerCore** is a modding API for **Minecraft BE** 1.16.201. In past, when CoreEngine was actual all mods were written in JavaScript, so this bindness to JavaScript is still here in new InnerCore and it makes Java mod development uncomfortable on it.  
This library was made to fix this problem, become easiest and main solution for Java modding on InnerCore platform. Also this mod patches InnerCore's JS tile entites and a few popular libraries to make it a bit faster.

## Making your first mod with ICSTD
Docs are in early WIP stage as same as library itself, so just wait ðŸ‘€
